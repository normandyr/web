                        classification techniques with a skewed data set.  
                        Classification methods examined include:  SVM, KNN, Naïve Bayes, 
                        and Logistic Regression through use of scikit learn Python framework.  
                        The dataset used was skewed and imbalanced and evaluated without 
                        any sampling techniques and with sampling techniques designed 
                        to reduce the effects of skew.  Sampling techniques used include
                         both up-sampling and down-sampling.

                                robot game was developed using JavaScript and 
                                the matter.js framework.  The robot was able to extend 
                                and retract its limbs and could grow and shrink in 
                                size.  An indicator bar was available to the user to 
                                see how much limbs were extended or retracted from 
                                initial point along with an indicator bar to show users 
                                how much the current robot had grown or shrunk in 
                                comparison to initial size.  The user could control 
                                the robot with various keyboard input which allowed 
                                them to move forward and backward, scale the robot up 
                                or down, and extend or retract the robot’s limbs. 
                                Scalable Vector Graphics (Svgs) were used as an input 
                                terrain.  The goal was to transform the robot when 
                                necessary to make it through the terrain.

                                in the United States based on year.  
                                This information was shared to the user through 
                                our website and we provided an option for the 
                                user to share the information to their own 
                                Twitter account through Twitter token authorization.
